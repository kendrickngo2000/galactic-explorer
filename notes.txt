 here lies some notes

- Animation class done 
	- idle, run, and jump images are looped 
	- camera offsets are set accordinly 
	- animation images are flipped when player faces a certain direction (left or right) 

- Level editor
	- there are primiitive approaches (0 and 1 to represent air/ground) 
	- we are using json (although json has no support for tupples)
